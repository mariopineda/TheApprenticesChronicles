This page? It’s not for show. It’s for me.

I’m officially apprenticing in goldsmithing. Not in some dreamy sunlit atelier — but in the stolen hours before dawn, in the quiet when the house is asleep, in the corners of a life already full to the brim. And I’m doing it with Jewellery Training Solutions, under the guidance of Peter Keep — because if I’m going to learn, I’m going to learn it right.

This blog is my written accountability.
My vow to myself.
My proof of commitment.
It’s where I put down the truth — raw, real, unfiltered — about what it takes to chase mastery one project at a time.

This isn’t for followers, fame, or some romanticized idea of craftsmanship.
This is for the days when I don’t want to do the work and need a reminder that I said I would.
This is for the long haul.
This is for showing up.

And if someone out there finds this and feels a spark, a push, a sense that they too can start late, start tired, start now — then good. Welcome. But that’s just a side effect.

The main thing?
I’m here. I’m learning. I’m not stopping.

“Discipline is choosing between what you want now and what you want most.”
— Abraham Lincoln… or maybe just the truth

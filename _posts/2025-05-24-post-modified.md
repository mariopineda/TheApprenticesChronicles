This space is for me. No audience, no polish, no pretending. Just a quiet ledger of a journey I’ve put off for years — maybe decades — and have finally decided to begin.

I’ve always been drawn to tools, to the weight of a hammer in hand, to materials that resist and yield with effort and heat. Goldsmithing has lived at the edges of my life for a long time, whispering now and then, reminding me it was still there. Life gave me good reasons to wait: work, family, other passions. But deep down, I knew I’d have to come back to it — not out of obligation, but because it’s part of how I understand myself.

This blog will document my apprenticeship through Jewellery Training Solutions (JTS), the program designed by Peter Keep, whose teaching balances technical rigor with humility and real-world wisdom. I respect the structure. I need the discipline. The JTS pathway gives me a clear roadmap, but the work — the learning, the time, the failures and little victories — that’s all on me.

I’m not here to “build a brand” or make this something bigger than it is. I’m here because I need a place to track the process. Somewhere to write down what I’ve learned, what went wrong, what surprised me, what burned, what clicked. I want to look back someday and see the long arc of becoming. The things I thought I’d never figure out. The tools that became extensions of my hands. The day a solder seam ran clean and smooth, finally.

There’s no pressure here. Just one post at a time. One project at a time. One skill at a time. This is how I’ll hold myself accountable. This is where I’ll keep the notes. This is my own quiet apprenticeship journal.
